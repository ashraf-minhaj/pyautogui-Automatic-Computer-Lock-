# pyautogui-Automatic-Computer-Lock-
For some reason pyautogui.hotkey('win', 'l') doesn't work. That's why I wrote a code that will automatically lock the pc if the code is run. Run the code or squeeze those few lines in your existing code then use it. 

*Run the code like this in you command prompt or powershell
________________________________________
> >python pyautogui.lock.py
________________________________________

*squeezze or add inside your code
_____________________________
> >if _your condition_: 
       lock the pc
_____________________________

Note:
To make this code work you must need to install python on your computer. 
After installing python install pyautogui 
___________________________________________________
> >pip install pyautogui
---------------------------------------------------
pyautogui works both for python 2 and 3.
