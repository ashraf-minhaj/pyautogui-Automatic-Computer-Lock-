# pyautogui-Automatic-Computer-Lock-
For some reason pyautogui.hotkey('win', 'l') doesn't work. That's why I wrote a code that will automatically lock the pc if the code is run. 

Note:
To make this code work you must need to install python on your computer. pyautogui works both for python 2 and 3. 
After installing python install pyautogui 
___________________________________________________
> pip install pyautogui
